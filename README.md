# Codeforces Solutions

Welcome to my **Codeforces Solutions** repository! This repository contains solutions to the problems I have attempted on [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com). Each solution is implemented in **C++** and organized for easy reference and learning.

## About Me
I am an enthusiastic competitive programmer aiming to improve my problem-solving skills while sharing my solutions with the community. You can check out my Codeforces profile here: [jhaanimesh1903](https://codeforces.com/profile/jhaanimesh1903).

## Repository Structure
The repository is structured based on contest numbers and problem codes for easy navigation.

```
.
â”œâ”€â”€ Contest_Number/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Problem_Code.cpp
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ...
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
```

## Features
- **C++ Solutions**: All solutions are implemented in C++, leveraging its speed and versatility for competitive programming.
- **Problem Links**: Each solution includes a link to the corresponding Codeforces problem.
- **Organized**: Solutions are grouped by contest numbers and problem codes for better accessibility.
- **Commented Code**: Solutions contain comments to explain the approach and logic used.

## How to Use
1. Browse through the folders to find solutions by contest and problem code.
2. Refer to the comments in the code for a detailed explanation of the approach.
3. Practice and improve your own problem-solving skills by comparing approaches.

## Contribution
Feel free to explore, suggest improvements, or share alternative approaches to the problems.
